Hi!  Welcome to _The Project_, which is what a few of us are calling the sum of the enlightened technology projects and next edge systems orbiting in our spheres. It is very early days in this repo! Come take a look and cocreate with us.

Note that Github is designed for coders! Which is why we have a how-to on "[Collaborating Like a Hacker](https://github.com/harlantwood/The_Project/blob/master/Collaborating-Like-a-Hacker.markdown)", to train our communities in using this powerful technology, which powers much of the modern open source software movement. 

For more inspiration and details, check out some recent posts:
